# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This week was a bit stressful. Learning a whole new framework was exciting and terrifying at the same time. I think overall I did okay, but I am excited to continue to learn it because I see why people like it. I am a little nervous for the checkpoint, but I think I can do it well!

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
On Thursday I was finally picking things up and felt more comfortable with the Vue framework.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I think I came into this week a little cocky, so I was surprised by how different and difficult the new framework is.
- What are you struggling with?
I have been a little sick so my brain hasn't been working and the new framework was also scary so I think this week was just a slight struggle overall.
- What would you count as a victory?
During partner work it felt like me and my partner flew through things and I think that was the lab that I had the least amount of errors in, which was a total victory.
