# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.
This week was good but hard. I felt like I learned a lot, but it was stressful because of many different aspects. When we first thought about the capstone I wanted my group to be as small as possible, but we just so happened to have the biggest group. It has been hard dealing with all the different voices with different opinions, especially when the opinions are not very good. Overall I think it has been okay, but would have been better with less people.
## Prompts
- What went well this week?
We got a lot done, and I personally think our application looks pretty professional.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
Kind of this week and last week, dealing with our external api was a big shock learning what we could do just with the back end and an api.
- What are you struggling with?
I still struggle when things are brand new. With references I feel like I can do almost anything, but if I havent learned it I have trouble figuring out what to do and where to go next.
- What would you count as a victory?
I think just surviving the last few weeks with all the checkpoints and big projects has been a very big victory.
