# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.
This week was the first week of C#, and I am still not sure if I like it or not. I can see the benefits and by the end of the week I have gotten a lot quicker with the set up, but I still think express node is better? Overall I still like backend more than front end. My goal is to get this all_spice done by next week so I can feel good going into the final, because currently I am so incredibly scared for the final and don't think I will pass. The next two weeks are going to be very hard, but I feel like are going to be very important.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I feel like I picked up C# faster than I have pretty much anything else.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
How freaking fast C# works compared to node.
- What are you struggling with?
I am still struggling with Vue on the front end.
- What would you count as a victory?
I think still being here in week 10 and really enjoying it is a victory in itself.
