# Final Reflection

The final week, the final day of coursework. How did it go? Are you ready for the Final week?
I did not see this and honestly would not have filled them out during the final. I have officially passed my final and will graduate from Boise Code Works! It was such a journey and I am proud of myself for how far I have come. I will say looking back now I am a little upset with myself because I got very discouraged and did different than I have this whole course. I put a ton of pressure on myself and did not take any breaks, and that hindered my progress. Other than that I am pumped that I have passed!

## Prompts

* What went well this week?
I passed my final!!
* What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I learned just how important taking breaks is. After I was forced to take a break I came back and figured things out (thanks jeremy)
* What are you struggling with?
I worked my butt off so I am pretty exhausted mentally and emotionally.
* What would you count as a victory?
Being able to finish the course on a high note! NO STRIKES BABY!
