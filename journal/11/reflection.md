# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.
Tomorrow is the day we get our final and I am incredibly nervous for it. I did not finish the project before because I was struggling. I know it was not as fleshed out, but I am still nervous. The next week is going to be a lot of hard work, but I really think this is something that I can do. Just got to work hard and not be afraid to ask questions when I need help.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I am still surprised by how fast I picked up C# back end and think that is going to be what I do well on the final
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
It is hard to explain but the JOIN LEFT on the backend was pretty cool and I plan to use that method in the final.
- What are you struggling with?
I would still say I am struggling with VUE and that is what makes me scared because of how important that'll be on the final.
- What would you count as a victory?
The fact that I am still here with no strikes is such a victory for me.
