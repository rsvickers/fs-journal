# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This week felt a lot better than the first week of JavaScript. I do not know if it is because I am practicing more, or if I understand the MCV model better than normal java. Or because the references have been really good! No matter what it was, my confidence has gone up since last week.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I enjoyed the MVC model and felt like most all of my labs went well!
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
The fact that using more javascripts helped a lot more than having one bg one. The initial thought was terrifying.
- What are you struggling with?
I feel like I am still struggling with the basics of JavScript, and I rely heavy on my references.
- What would you count as a victory?
I count my labs as a victory this week because I feel like for the most part it went very smooth!
