# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This week was my favorite week of the course so far (I understand its only out of 4) but knock on wood this is the most I have understood and the most confident I have been overall. I still use references heavy, but I know where to look and how I want to do my own. The thursday lab I did use little to no references, but had good help from my partner. Overall I really enjoyed this week and feel happy with what is going on in this course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I think my overall understanding of the MVC model and using API's was better than expected.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
The thought of API as a whole was a complete shock, but I really enjoyed it.

- What are you struggling with?
I struggle with not using references heavy.

- What would you count as a victory?
I think this week overall (this is pre checkpoint Rhys talking) was a victory in total! Also, I thought Jeremy referring to me as the dungeon master was a victory.
