# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | Synchronous code has one statement and waits for to finish before moving on. Asynchronous allows you to have multiple functions that run at the same time. |

02. What is an event listener?

  > | A dude that lives inside the computer that stares at a keyword and draws the function whenever the keyword is used. |

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > | REST stands for representational state transfer.  |

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > | A function that is passed to another function with the hopes and dreams that the other function will call it. |

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > | a promise is a returned value that is promised to happen eventually. you need to await the function that returns the promise so you do not get an error. |

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > | Get, Post, Put, Delete (I am a overachiever) |

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > | Application programming interface |

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | Have an async beforehand. |

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > | Makes it so that data is not bundled up with data that is not pertained to it. Helps with security. |

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > | 200 |

11. What is a 400 error?

  > | Means something went wrong and its not working. |
