# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

The initial thought of running the backend was fairly scary, because new things are always scary. In all reality I really enjoyed doing the back end and in my hackathon I personally would rather run the back end. Right now I like how repetitive it is, because the best way to be good at something is doing it over and over again. I am also super excited for the first hackathon and pumped to see what we end up making. 

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Overall the week went rally well and I felt like I learned a ton.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I am shocked to learn I currently enjoy the back end more than I do the front.
- What are you struggling with?
Postman is still a little confusing to me, but I am getting used to it.
- What would you count as a victory?
I think creating my own API from the backend is a complete victory this week!
