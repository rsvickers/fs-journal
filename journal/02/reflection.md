# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This week was the first week of learning JavaScript. I still feel like I am not picking it up as quickly as everybody else and I am a bit scared for the rest of this cohort if I feel like this week 2. Near the end I started kind of understanding more, but I really feel like I am at the bottom of the barrel with everything. 

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
During partner work there were a few times that I rewrote the code and it actually worked and that felt good.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
JavaScript in general was/is a shock to learn and I am still confused.
- What are you struggling with?
JavaScript. Just basically everything!
- What would you count as a victory?
I count not giving up and the time I rewrote the code with my partner was a solid victory for me.
