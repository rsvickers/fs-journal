# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > |lets us work from our own computer but be able to save it so others can work on it, as well as be able to continue to work on a project if the main computer is lost. Basically like uploading to the cloud but for code. |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | make directory |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | these classes helps specialize an element. Ones that I think we are going to use the most are hover and link tags.|

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | how something is applied if there are similar elements with different values |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | Because then nothing would be important. |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | the h1 element, the color with the : and the actual color; |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | a good design is more appealing to the eye and shows that the person who created the website cares about what they are showing. |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | the purpose is to get a rough draft of what you want the website layout to look like. |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | With the use of bootstrap I think it is worth the time, energy and effort because it gives layout of what to do when you actually get to code. |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | it allows everything in the flex property to move around but stay similar to everything around it.|

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | height and width |
