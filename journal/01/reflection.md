# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

After the first week I feel pretty okay with things. I think I am suffering from imposter syndrome and I am making the future of this course seem terrifying. Going into week 2 I am excited to continue to learn but I keep having a itching feeling in the back of my mind that I am going to fall behind everybody the harder this course gets. I feel bipolar because some moments I feel really good and excited for the future, and then other moments I feel like I shouldn't be here and should just quit.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I feel like I learned more in two days that I did in a whole semester at BSU. I was pretty happy with my first checkpoint and how it looks.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I learned quite a bit in bootstrap and it felt pretty natural which was a surprise considering I had never heard of bootstrap before the week started.
- What are you struggling with?
Currently I am struggling with confidence. I feel like I am one of the worst ones here and my mind keeps telling me that I am going to continue to fall behind.
- What would you count as a victory?
I count finishing the week a huge victory! The start of a new school, especially one as hard as this is a terrifying idea, so the fact that I did the first week made me feel good.
